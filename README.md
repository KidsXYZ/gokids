# gokids
Main portal for the kids.xyz portal 

Thanks for stopping by, this repo still looks deserted but I have some great plans in my head I need to work out. 

Kids.XYZ is going to be an project by me (and hopefully some contributers in the future) for allowing kids from the age 3 - 10/12 to have an safe environment where to connect online with their friends. 

You can see it as an Facebookian project but without the datamining, without the adds, without intrusive promoted content. Everything is private by default and the parents decide what can be public. 

- Features (for now)
  - Kids profile 
  - Parents profile 
  - Groups ( School, Daycare, Sportclub ) 
  - Friends 
  - Small Gallery
  - Blog 
  - Youtube feeds 
  - Creativespot 
  - Games (Educational) 
  - Educational section with interactive courses ( need to find someone who is willing to provide these for free )
  - Global Managers ( Handpicked pool of supporters to monitor the content to be kids safe . )
  
- Codebase 
  - Project will be written in golang 
  - Frontend as basic as possible without large javascript packages. 
  - Postgresql database 
  - aws hosted 
  
  
  END OF DRAFT
